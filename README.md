# MedKGent: A Large Language Model Agent Framework for Constructing Temporally Evolving Medical Knowledge Graph

Welcome to the **MedKGent** repository! This repository will contain the code for **MedKGent**, a framework designed for constructing temporally evolving medical knowledge graphs using large language models. The code is currently being organized and will be available shortly. In the meantime, you can explore the **Medical Knowledge Graph** built using the MedKGent framework here: [MedKGent-KG Dataset on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ShowerMaker/MedKGent-KG).
